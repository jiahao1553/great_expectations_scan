# Contribute to Great Expectations documentation

This repository contains the following templates that you can use to create Great Expectations documentation:

- [how-to](../team_templates/how_to_template.md)
- [tutorial](../team_templates/tutorial_template.md)
- [conceptual](../team_templates/conceptual_template.md)
- [reference](../team_templates/reference_template.md)

These templates are intended for use by Great Expectations employees. If you're not a Great Expectations employee and want to contribute to Great Expectations documentation, see the [README](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/docs/README.md) in the `docs` repository.

 ## Create a new document from a template

1. Create a new branch on `develop`. See [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).

2. Select and copy a template in the `team_templates` folder. Keep your copy of the template in the `team_templates` folder.

3. Rename the template you copied using underscores as delimiters. For example, `use_great_expectations_with_airflow`.

4. Open your renamed template file in a source code editor and follow the instructions in the template to complete it.

5. When you're finished adding content to the template, and it's ready for review, remove all comments and unused sections and then create a pull request. See [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

    Add a meaningful title and description for your PR. The description should include the [DOCS] identifier in the PR title. For example, [DOCS] Integrate Great Expectations with Snowflake. 
    
    Add at least one member of the technical documentation team as a reviewer.

6. Notify the team that a new document is ready for review on the [team-devrel Slack channel](https://greatexpectationslabs.slack.com/archives/C054HH4LZM4).
