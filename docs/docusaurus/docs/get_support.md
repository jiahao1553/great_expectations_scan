description: Learn what resources are available to help you resolve issues with GX OSS.

GX is open source software (OSS) and relies on an active user community for its continued success. Input from users like you helps Great Expectations and the community build its collective knowledge and improve GX OSS. Knowing how and where to seek support will help you get the answers you need to resolve issues.

## Try solving your issue first

The following are some recommendations for resolving issues on your own. Resolving issues on your own builds your own knowledge and provides you with an opportunity to share that knowledge with the community. 

### Search the GX documentation

Search the docs you're using currently for an answer to your issue or question. If you're new to GX OSS, try the [Quickstart](tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.md) or one of the specific getting started guides such as [Get started with Great Expectations and Databricks](tutorials/getting_started/how_to_use_great_expectations_in_databricks.md), or [Get started with Great Expectations and SQL](tutorials/getting_started/how_to_use_great_expectations_with_sql.md).  

### Search with your favorite search engine

It's very likely that someone, somewhere has previously encountered or solved the issue you're currently experiencing. Open a browser and perform a keyword search in your preferred search engine to discover resources outside GX documentation. 

### Try it out

If you're wondering what might happen when you implement a solution, try it out! If you attempt a solution in your development environment, users are unaffected and unaware of what you're up to. Sneaky. 

## Ask the right questions and provide the right information

Taking the time to formulate your questions properly and providing all the relevant background information can save time and improve response times. The following are some recommendations that will help the GX Developer Advocates (DAs) and other community members help you. 

### Include all the relevant information

Clearly explain the issue you're experiencing, or the problem you're trying to solve. When asking questions, you should provide the following:

- The complete error log or logs.

- The relevant code you're trying to run.

- The version of GX OSS you're using.

- A detailed explanation of what you're trying to resolve including what attempts you've made on your own to date.

### Don't post in multiple channels and use threads

When posting questions or asking for help in one of the GX Slack channels, don't post in multiple channels. Instead, select a single, relevant channel and post your message there. When responding to a post, use threads. If you need to post large code blocks, post them in a thread to avoid overwhelming the channel.

### Don't tag individual users

Even if you've previously developed a rapport with a specific GX DA, or a community member, don't tag them in new Slack posts. GX DA and community member availability varies. Also, the GX DAs operate on a rotation schedule to ensure equal time working with the open source community, and you never know who is available or who has the knowledge to solve your issue. Tagging specific users can limit the scope of the response. Also, the community is typically very responsive and helpful. If you don't get a response within a reasonable time, review your post and ensure you've framed your questions correctly and provided the necessary background information. If you don't get a response, or it's unhelpful, try an alternate medium to resolve your issue.

## Select the correct medium for questions and support

GX provides the following resources for questions and support:

- If you've encountered an error and are stuck, get support on the [GX Discourse forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/oss-support/11). This is the recommended option as answers aren't removed after 90 days, and you're likely to get a quicker response. 

- If you've found a bug, open an issue in one of the [GX GitHub repositories](https://github.com/great-expectations)

- If you want to chat with community members about general issues and solutions, join the [GX Slack community](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/CUTCNHN82)
