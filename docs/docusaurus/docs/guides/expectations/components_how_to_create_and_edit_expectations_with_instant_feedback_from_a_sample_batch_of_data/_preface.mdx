This guide will take you through the process of creating <TechnicalTag tag="expectation" text="Expectations" /> in Interactive Mode.  The term "Interactive Mode" denotes the fact that you are interacting with your data as you work.  In other words, you have access to a <TechnicalTag tag="datasource" text="Data Source" /> and can specify a <TechnicalTag tag="batch" text="Batch" /> of data to be used to create Expectations against.  Working in interactive mode will not edit your data: you are only using it to run your Expectations against.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites>

- [Configured a Data Context](/docs/guides/setup/configuring_data_contexts/instantiating_data_contexts/instantiate_data_context).
- [Created a Data Source](/docs/guides/connecting_to_your_data/connect_to_data_overview).

</Prerequisites>

## Steps

### 1. Import Great Expectations and get a Data Context

### 2. Build a Batch Request using a previously created Data Asset

### 3. Create a Validator

:::info Working outside of a Jupyter Notebook

In a Jupyter Notebook, the results for a given cell are automatically displayed when you run the cell.  If you're using a different interpreter, you might need to add the following method to explicitly print these results:

```python title="Python code" name="tests/integration/docusaurus/validation/validator/how_to_create_and_edit_expectations_with_instant_feedback_fluent.py inspect_data_no_jupyter"
```

### 4. Create an Expectation

:::info Working outside of a Jupyter Notebook

If you're using a different interpreter, you might need to add the following method to explicitly print these results:

```python title="Python code" name=name="tests/integration/docusaurus/validation/validator/how_to_create_and_edit_expectations_with_instant_feedback_fluent.py interactive_validation_no_jupyter"
```

### 5. Repeat step 4 to edit Expectation values or add additional Expectations


### 6. Save your Expectations
