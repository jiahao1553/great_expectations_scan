title: Trigger Email as an Action
---

import TechnicalTag from '@site/docs/term_tags/_tag.mdx';

This guide will help you trigger emails as an <TechnicalTag tag="action" text="Action" /> . It will allow you to send an email including information about a <TechnicalTag tag="validation_result" text="Validation Result" />, including whether or not the <TechnicalTag tag="validation" text="Validation" /> succeeded.

## Prerequisites 

* An email account configured on the SMTP server you're going to use to send email
* Identified the email addresses for sent messages
* A <TechnicalTag tag="checkpoint" text="Checkpoint" /> configured to send email

## Edit your configuration variables with email related information

Open `uncommitted/config_variables.yml` file and add the following variables by adding the following lines:

```yaml
smtp_address: [address of the smtp server]
smtp_port: [port used by the smtp server]
sender_login: [login used to send the email]
sender_password: [password used to send the email]
sender_alias: [optional alias used to send the email (default = sender_login)]
receiver_emails: [addresses you want to send the email to]  # each address must be separated by commas
```

## Update `action_list` in your Checkpoint configuration

Locate the relevant checkpoint that you want to set up an email trigger for. Open the checkpoint's configuration file that is located at `great_expectations/checkpoints/` (for example, `great_expectations/checkpoints/checkpoint_01.yml`) and add an email action to the `action_list`. Follow the snippet below to set up the detials of your email trigger.

```yaml
action_list:
  - name: send_email_on_validation_result # name can be set to any value
    action:
      class_name: EmailAction
      notify_on: all # possible values: "all", "failure", "success"
      notify_with: # optional list containing the DataDocs sites to include in the notification. Defaults to including links to all configured sites.
      # You can choose between using SSL encryption, TLS encryption or none of them (not advised)
      use_tls: False
      use_ssl: True
      renderer:
        module_name: great_expectations.render.renderer.email_renderer
        class_name: EmailRenderer
      # put the actual following information in the uncommitted/config_variables.yml file
      # or pass in as environment variable
      smtp_address: ${smtp_address}
      smtp_port: ${smtp_port}
      sender_login: ${sender_login}
      sender_password: ${sender_password}
      sender_alias: ${sender_alias}
      receiver_emails: ${receiver_emails}  # string containing email addresses separated by commas
```

## Test your updated Action list

Run your Checkpoint to Validate a <TechnicalTag tag="batch" text="Batch" /> of data and receive an email on the success or failure of the Validation. See
[Run your Checkpoint](../checkpoints/how_to_create_a_new_checkpoint.md).

If successful, you should receive an email that looks like this:

## Additional notes

If your `great_expectations.yml` contains multiple configurations for Data Docs sites, all of them will be included in the email by default. If you would like to be more specific, you can configure the `notify_with` variable in your Checkpoint configuration.

The following example will configure the email to include links <TechnicalTag tag="data_docs" text="Data Docs" /> at local_site and s3_site.

```yaml
# Example data_docs_sites configuration in `great_expectations.yml`
data_docs_sites:
  local_site:
    class_name: SiteBuilder
    show_how_to_buttons: true
    store_backend:
      class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
      base_directory: uncommitted/data_docs/local_site/
    site_index_builder:
      class_name: DefaultSiteIndexBuilder
  s3_site:  # this is a user-selected name - you may select your own
    class_name: SiteBuilder
    store_backend:
      class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
      bucket: data-docs.my_org  # UPDATE the bucket name here to match the bucket you configured above.
    site_index_builder:
      class_name: DefaultSiteIndexBuilder
      show_cta_footer: true
```

```yaml
# Example Checkpoint configuration
action_list:
  - name: send_email_on_validation_result # name can be set to any value
    action:
      class_name: EmailAction
      notify_on: all # possible values: "all", "failure", "success"
      #--------------------------------
      # This is what was configured
      #--------------------------------
      notify_with:
        - local_site
        - gcs_site
      use_ssl: True
      use_tls: False
      renderer:
        module_name: great_expectations.render.renderer.email_renderer
        class_name: EmailRenderer
      # put the actual following information in the uncommitted/config_variables.yml file
      # or pass in as environment variable
      smtp_address: ${smtp_address}
      smtp_port: ${smtp_port}
      sender_login: ${sender_login}
      sender_password: ${sender_password}
      sender_alias: ${sender_alias}
      receiver_emails: ${receiver_emails} # string containing email addresses separated by commas
```
