Now that you have a full Data Source configuration, you can confirm that it is valid by testing it with the `.test_yaml_config(...)` method.  To do this, execute the Python code:

```python name="test your config with test_yaml_config"
```

When executed, `test_yaml_config` will instantiate the component described by the yaml configuration that is passed in and then run a self check procedure to verify that the component works as expected.

For a Data Source, this includes:
- confirming that the connection works
- gathering a list of available Data Assets
- verifying that at least one Batch can be fetched from the Data Source
