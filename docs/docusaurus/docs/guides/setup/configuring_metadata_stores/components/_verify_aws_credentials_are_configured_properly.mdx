Run the following command in the AWS CLI to verify that your AWS credentials are properly configured:

```bash title="Terminal command"
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

When your credentials are properly configured, your `UserId`, `Account`, and `Arn` are returned.  If your credentials are not configured correctly, an error message appears. If you received an error message, or you couldn't verify your credentials, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
