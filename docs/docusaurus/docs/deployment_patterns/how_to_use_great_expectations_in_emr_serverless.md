EMR Serverless is a deployment option for Amazon EMR that provides a serverless runtime environment.  It simplifies the operation of analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks, such as Apache Hive or Apache Spark.  EMR Serverless removes the need to configure, secure, optimize, and operate clusters for running applications with supported frameworks.
