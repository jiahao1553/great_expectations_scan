:::tip What if my Data Assets are located in different folders?

You can access files that are nested in folders under your Data Source's `base_directory`!

If your Data Assets are located in multiple folders, you can use the folder that contains those folders as your `base_directory`.  When you define a Data Asset for your Data Source, you can then include the folder path (relative to your `base_directory`) in the regular expression that indicates which files to connect to.
