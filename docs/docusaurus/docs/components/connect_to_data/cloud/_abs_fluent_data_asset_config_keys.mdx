To specify data to connect to you can specify the following elements:
- `name`: A name by which you can reference the Data Asset in the future.
- `batching_regex`: A regular expression that indicates which files to treat as batches in your Data Asset and how to identify them.
- `abs_container`: The name of your Azure Blob Storage container.
- `abs_name_starts_with`: A string indicating what part of the `batching_regex` to truncate from the final batch names.
- `abs_recursive_file_discovery`: (Optional) A boolean (True/False) indicating if files should be searched recursively from subfolders

1. Run the following Python code to define the connection values:

    ```python title="Python code"
    asset_name = "my_taxi_data_asset"
    batching_regex = r"yellow_tripdata_sample_(?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d{2})\.csv"
    abs_container = "my_container"
    abs_name_starts_with = "data/taxi_yellow_tripdata_samples/"
    ```
