The Google Cloud Platform documentation describes how to verify [authentication for the Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started), which includes:

- Creating a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account.
- Setting the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable,
- Verifying authentication by running a simple [Google Cloud Storage client](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries) library script.
