---

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to connect GX Cloud to Snowflake Data Assets.

## Prerequisites

- You have a [GX Cloud Beta account](https://greatexpectations.io/cloud).

- You have a [Snowflake account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-admin) with USAGE privileges on the table, database, and schema you are validating, and you know your password.

- You have a [Docker instance](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Generate your user access token and copy your organization ID

You'll need your user access token and organization ID to set your environment variables. Access tokens shouldn't be committed to version control software.

1. In GX Cloud, click **Settings** > **Tokens**.

2. In the **Access tokens** pane, click **Create user access token**.

3. Complete the following fields:

    - **Token name** - Enter a name for the token that will help you quickly identify it.

    - **Role** - Select **Admin**. For more information about the available roles, click **Information** (?).

4. Click **Create**.

5. Copy and then paste the user access token into a temporary file. The token can't be retrieved after you close the dialog.

6. Click **Close**.

7. Copy the value in the **Organization ID** field into the temporary file with your user access token and then save the file. 

    GX recommends deleting the temporary file after you set the environment variables.

## Set the environment variables and start the GX Cloud agent

Environment variables securely store your GX Cloud and Snowflake access credentials. The GX Cloud agent runs open source GX code in GX Cloud, and it allows you to securely access your data without connecting to it or interacting with it directly. 

1. Start the Docker Engine.

2. Run the following code to set the `GX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `GX_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID`, and `GX_CLOUD_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` environment variables, install GX Cloud and its dependencies, and start the GX Cloud agent:

    ```bash title="Terminal input"
    docker run --rm -e GX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="<user_access_token>" -e GX_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID="<organization_id>" -e GX_CLOUD_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD="<snowflake_password>" greatexpectations/agent
    ```
    Replace `user_access_token`, `organization_id`, and `snowflake_password` with your own values. 

3. Optional. If you created a temporary file to record your user access token and Organization ID, delete it.

4. Optional. Run `docker ps` or open Docker Desktop to confirm the agent is running.

    If you stop the GX Cloud agent, close the terminal, and open a new terminal you'll need to set the environment variables again.

    To edit an environment variable, stop the GX Cloud agent, edit the environment variable, save the change, and then restart the GX Cloud agent.

## Create the Snowflake Data Asset

Create a Data Asset to define the data you want GX Cloud to access within Snowflake. 

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets** > **New Asset**.

2. Complete the following mandatory fields:

    - **Datasource name**: Enter a meaningful name for the Data Asset.

    - **Username**: Enter your Snowflake username.

    - **Password variable**: Enter `GX_CLOUD_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`.

    - **Account or locator**: Enter your Snowflake account or locator information. The locator value must include the geographical region. For example, `us-east-1`. To locate these values see [Account Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier).

3. Optional. Complete the following fields:

    - **Database**: Enter the name of the Snowflake database where the data you want to validate is stored.
 
    - **Schema**: Enter the name of the schema for the Snowflake database where the data you want to validate is stored.

    - **Warehouse**: Enter the name of the Snowflake database warehouse.

    - **Role**: Enter your Snowflake role.

    - **Authenticator**: Enter the Snowflake database authenticator that you want to use to verify your Snowflake connection. 

4. Optional. Clear **Create temp table** if you don't want to create a temporary database table.

5. Optional. Clear **Test connection** if you don't want to test the Data Asset connection.

6. Select **Table Asset** or **Query Asset** and complete the following fields:

    - **Asset name**: Enter a name for the Data Asset.

    - **Table name**: When **Table Asset** is selected, enter a name for the table you're creating in the Data Asset.

    - **Query**: When **Query Asset** is selected, enter the query that you want to run on the table. 

7. Optional. Select **Add table/query** to add additional tables or queries and repeat step 6.

8. Click **Finish**.

## Add an Expectation

An Expectation is a verifiable assertion about your data. They make implicit assumptions about your data explicit.

1. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Snowflake Data Asset name.

2. Click **New Expectation**.

3. Select an Expectation type, enter the column name, and then complete the optional fields.

    If you prefer to work in a code editor, click the **JSON Editor** tab and define your Expectation parameters in the code pane.

4. Click **Save**.

5. Optional. Repeat steps 1 to 4 to add additional Expectations.

## Validate Expectations

1. Click **Validate**.

2. When the confirmation message appears, click **See results**, or click the **Validations** tab.
